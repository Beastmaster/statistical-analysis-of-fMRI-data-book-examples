===============================================

Examples from *Statiscal Analysis of fMRI data* by F. Gregory Ashby.


The orginal coding examples are in MATLAB and can be downloaded from [F. Gregory Ashby's website ](https://labs.psych.ucsb.edu/ashby/gregory/Matlab.html). This is a Python version of the coding examples.

I decided to change the names of variables to increase readability. I did not change any functions or values for the parameters.
